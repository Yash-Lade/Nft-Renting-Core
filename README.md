The core logic for secure and flexible NFT renting on the blockchain.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
nft-renting-core is a smart contract-based system that enables NFT owners to rent out their assets securely while maintaining ownership. Renters can temporarily access NFT utilities (like in-game items, memberships, or digital art) without full transfer of ownership.

This core module can be integrated into NFT marketplaces, games, or dApps that wish to provide NFT utility on a time-based lease model.
